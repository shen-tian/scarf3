Design ideas:

Two layers. One background, the other overlay.

Then, overall effects adjustments.

Add a small screen to the board, along with maybe three buttons? 

One to cycle mode 

- bg select < >
- overlay select < >
- fx select < >

Underlying, there should be a bunch of params. Use a remote to control those.
